#0.7.0
<ul>
	<li>Major change to mercurial scm</li>
	<li>added Apache 2.0 license</li>
	<li>added commandline toolset apptools</li>
	<li>standalone bakeout application</li>
	<li>added social plugins</li>
</ul>

#0.6.0
<ul>
	<li>Major upgrade to ETS 4.0. Install >EPD7.1.1, "enthought" namespace removed</li>
	<li>added CameraCalibrationManager use to calculate px per mm value and drive_ratios</li>
	<li>added drive_ratio to axis config. defines request/actual displacement ratio. </li>
</ul>

#0.5.1
<ul>
	<li>added hysteresis correction for kerr motors. hystersis value set in config file </li>
	<li>added a context filter to the RemoteHardwareManager. Frequency filter is currently static 
	but in the future will adjust based on previous responses</li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

#0.5.0
<ul>
	<li>significant work on laser motion and calibration</li>
	<li><font color="red">camera.cfg now uses xcamera_coefficients and ycamera_coefficients. 
		Appears the camera is not true 640x480 pixels</font></li>
	<li>added bitmap generator for making laser tray bitmaps</li>
	<li>major code reformatting and clean up</li>
</ul>

#0.4.4
<ul>
	<li>added choice of stage calibrations. MassSpec (actual/actual) or pychron (actual/virtual). Pychron calibration requires accurate px to cm mapping and camera orthogonal to stage motion</li>
	<li>fixed motion parameter calculation</li>
	<li>added ability to delete individual hole tweaks. Place cursor over hole  when calibrating and hit delete (Backspace). only applicable to pychron calibration</li>
	<li>added stop button to laser manager. Stops axes motion'</li>
	<li>added manual jog. use arrows to move x-y</li>
</ul>

#0.4.3
<ul>
	<li><font color="red">changed camera.txt to config file (camera.cfg)</font></li>
	<li>added mirror option to camera config file</li>
</ul>

#0.4.2 
<ul>
	<li>added stage calibration routine</li>
	<li>added fast scan for power mapping</li> 
	<li>added version info display</li>
</ul>

#0.4.1
 
fixed open issues as of 6/20/2011 updated hardware manager updated laser manager
and stage managers added a step heat manager

#0.4.0 
started incorporating database support. added experimentmanager, experiment,
analysis, and measurementscript use experimentmanager to create an "experiment", a
series of analyses. Each analysis is an extraction line script and a measurement
script. The measurement script saves its data in memory and on file then the analysis
saves it to the database. analysis extraction premeasurement measurement precycle cycle
postcycle postmeasurement

#0.3.0 
added spectrometer manager and plugin updated graph manager, use to open and
display graphs updated ethernet communicator. now can use UDP added hardware plugin
views. Examine current state of hardware devices
started addig sphinx documentation

#0.2.0 
added synrad laser control fixed the RemoteHardwareServer.start_server function.
Was not handling commands

#0.1.9 
misc changes cleaned up scene_graph and interaction canvas. added pan to
interaction canvas. Hold down spacebar and drag cleaned up remote hardware and
messaging added error retrieval for agilent gp actuator hardware server can be started
and stopped from preferences

added featurator - a developer tool that should be run as a unittest before version
commits should be populated over time with new and legacy testcases purpose is to
automate bug detection

added links feature to remote hardware server Links use the select module to maintain
an TCP connection. This allows multiple commands to be sequentially issued over one
socket connection currently links are always on once they have been started

misc remote hardware server changes doesnt use server_forever anymore caused problems
for start and stop a thread calls start_server. uses loop and select

#0.1.8 
added misc timeseries funcs autocorr func seasonal subseries func smooth func
changed ploteditor to use tableeditor for series editors instead of
ListEditor(use_notebook=True) changed colornames to the standard named colors black,
red, maroon, yellow, olive, lime, gray, green, aqua, teal, blue, silver, navy, fuchsia,
purple

#0.1.7 
Explanation now displays Open/Close or On/Off instead of True/False Removed
stage window width an height preferences Minor canvas3D fixes added ability to auto
determine if beta version looks at __file__ and beta if directory name is pychron_beta

#0.1.6
added device streamer to extraction line manager added auto serial handle finder

#0.1.5
added setup.py to create a dist tarball

#0.1.4
added installer.py to build Mac OSX app changed application_launcher.py to
pychron.py added server_launcher icon
